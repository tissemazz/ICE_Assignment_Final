A React hook (>=16.8) for getting the current responsive media breakpoint, successor to [breakpoint-observer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/breakpoint-observer).

## Usage

Initialize `useBreakpoint` with a configuration object, and optionally a default breakpoint name (in non-window environments like SSR). The return value will be an object with the breakpoint's name (`string`), min-width, and max-width values (`number`):

```javascript
import useBreakpoint from 'use-breakpoint';

...

const CurrentBreakpoint = () => {
  const {
    breakpoint,
    maxWidth,
    minWidth
  } = useBreakpoint(
    { mobile: 0, tablet: 768, desktop: 1280 },
    'desktop'
  );

  return (
    <p>The current breakpoint is {breakpoint}!</p>
  );
};
```

## Functionality

This component uses the [window.matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) functionality to calculate the current breakpoint. For a list of breakpoints, we generate some css media queries in the form of `(min-width: XXXpx) and (max-width: YYYpx)` and then add listeners for the changes. `useBreakpoint` will then update its return value when the breakpoint changes from one rule to another.

## Developing

This project is built with [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/). A [Storybook](http://storybook.js.org/) is included for local previewing. The easiest way to get started is cloning the repo and starting the storybook server locally via `npm start`.
